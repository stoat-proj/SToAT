# SToAT: Open Statistical Toolkits <a href="https://github.com/statmlben/nonlinear-causal"><img src="./figs/logo.png" align="right" height="150" /></a>

The **stoat** project is a comprehensive initiative designed to enhance the development of essential, foundational, and practical statistical toolkits. Its overarching aim is to widen the scope of operability and practicality intrinsic to statistical concepts and methodologies. The principles of the Stoat project can be underscored as follows:

- **Open**. stoat supports open-source, and all toolkits will be published in Github.
- **Decentralization**. stoat does not claim credits for every project or toolkit. Rather, all credits associated with a particular project are duly accorded to the respective developers and contributors.
- **Cooperation**. stoat involves active cooperation between developers/contributors and mentors. Most projects are initiated by mentors who propose preliminary ideas and aims. The project then is progressively proceeded through collaboration between contributors and mentors.
- **Paid-position**. stoat offers paid short-term academic positions, such as research assistant (RA). In short, each contributor selected for a **stoat** project will get paid academic position to work on an Python/R package for 12 - 24 weeks.

## Acknowledge

**stoat** is initiated by several junior statistics PIs to contribute to the development of basic, fundamental and practical statistical toolkits. **stoat** is initially inspired by [Google Summer of Code](https://github.com/rstats-gsoc) initiative, and provides more flexible timeline, research-oriented projects, and offers paid university-based academic job positions.

**Support SToAT.** Stoat enthusiastically welcomes more co-PIs to join, providing opportunities for students interested in statistical software development, as well as contributing to the development and promotion of open-source statistical toolkits. The role of the PI is pivotal in overseeing the project, providing vision, direction, and coordinating the contributors' efforts. Please check [SToAT-wiki: Become a co-PI of SToAT](https://github.com/stoat-proj/SToAT/wiki/Become-a-PI-of-SToAT) for more information.
