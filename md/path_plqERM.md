# Fast Path Solution for PLQ ERM

## Introduction

Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) is a cornerstone of statistical learning, where the objective is to minimize the expected loss over a given dataset. PLQ ERM, which stands for Piecewise Linear Quadratic Empirical Risk Minimization, introduces a sophisticated loss function that captures complex relationships within data. This proposal focuses on developing a fast path solution for PLQ ERM, employing warm start techniques to efficiently handle large-scale datasets and complex constraints.

## Problem Definition

The PLQ ERM problem is defined as:

$$
\min_{\pmb{\beta} \in \mathbb{R}^d} \sum_{i=1}^n \text{PLQ}(y_i, \mathbf{x}_i^T \pmb{\beta}) + \frac{1}{2} \| \pmb{\beta} \|_2^2, \ \text{ s.t. } \ 
    \mathbf{A} \pmb{\beta} + \mathbf{b} \geq \mathbf{0},
$$

where:

- $\text{PLQ}(\cdot, \cdot)$ is a convex piecewise linear quadratic function, providing flexibility of loss functions to model various types of data distributions and relationships.
- $\mathbf{A}$ is a $K \times d$ matrix, and $\mathbf{b}$ is a $K$-dimensional vector, representing linear constraints on the parameter vector $\pmb{\beta}$.

## Motivation

Path solutions over different penalty strengths are valuable in statistical learning and optimization, especially when dealing with regularization in various loss functions.

[ReHLine](https://rehline-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is a powerful solver for PLQ ERM for a fix penalty strength or sample weight [^rehline]. We aim to develop a fast path solution for ReHLine, where utilizing warm start techniques is crucial for enabling practical applications in large-scale data environments, such as finance, healthcare, and recommendation systems.

To revise the aims with a focus on checking the code structure of `Lasso_path` in scikit-learn, we can incorporate specific objectives related to understanding and leveraging the code structure for our project. Here's a revised version of the aims:

## Aims

   - **Incorporate Best Practices**: Leverage insights gained from `Lasso_path` to inform the design and implementation of our fast path solution. This may involve adopting similar strategies for handling regularization paths and computational efficiency.

4. **Scalability and Efficiency**: Focus on optimizing the algorithm for scalability, ensuring it can handle high-dimensional data and large datasets. Explore techniques such as parallelization and advanced optimization strategies to enhance performance.

5. **Implementation and Testing**: Develop a robust software implementation of the solution, accompanied by comprehensive testing on synthetic and real-world datasets. Validate the accuracy and efficiency of the solution compared to existing methods.

6. **Benchmarking and Analysis**: Conduct a thorough benchmarking study to compare the proposed fast path solution with traditional ERM approaches. Analyze the strengths and weaknesses, focusing on convergence speed, scalability, and solution quality.

7. **Documentation and Dissemination**: Create detailed documentation and user guides to facilitate the adoption of the fast path solution for PLQ ERM. Disseminate findings through publications and presentations to contribute to the broader research community.
