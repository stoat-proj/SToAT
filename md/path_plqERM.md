# Fast Path Solution for PLQ ERM

## Introduction

Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) is a cornerstone of statistical learning, where the objective is to minimize the expected loss over a given dataset. PLQ ERM, which stands for Piecewise Linear Quadratic Empirical Risk Minimization, introduces a sophisticated loss function that captures complex relationships within data. This proposal focuses on developing a fast path solution for PLQ ERM, employing warm start techniques to efficiently handle large-scale datasets and complex constraints.

## Problem Definition

The PLQ ERM problem is defined as:

$$
\min_{\pmb{\beta} \in \mathbb{R}^d} \sum_{i=1}^n \text{PLQ}(y_i, \mathbf{x}_i^T \pmb{\beta}) + \frac{1}{2} \| \pmb{\beta} \|_2^2, \ \text{ s.t. } \ 
    \mathbf{A} \pmb{\beta} + \mathbf{b} \geq \mathbf{0},
$$

where:

- $\text{PLQ}(\cdot, \cdot)$ is a convex piecewise linear quadratic function, providing flexibility of loss functions to model various types of data distributions and relationships.
- $\mathbf{A}$ is a $K \times d$ matrix, and $\mathbf{b}$ is a $K$-dimensional vector, representing linear constraints on the parameter vector $\pmb{\beta}$.

## Motivation

Path solutions over different penalty strengths are valuable in statistical learning and optimization, especially when dealing with regularization in various loss functions.

[ReHLine](https://rehline-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is a powerful solver for PLQ ERM for a fix penalty strength or sample weight [^rehline]. We aim to develop a fast path solution for ReHLine, where utilizing warm start techniques is crucial for enabling practical applications in large-scale data environments, such as finance, healthcare, and recommendation systems.

To revise the aims with a focus on checking the code structure of `Lasso_path` in scikit-learn, we can incorporate specific objectives related to understanding and leveraging the code structure for our project. Here's a revised version of the aims:
